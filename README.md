# GPU-Project-Accelerated-Convex-Hull

## Farthest Frontier: An improved CUDA Implementation and Analysis for 2D Convex Hull Computation

This project was done as a part of the CS432 GPU Accelerated Programming course. The code explores parallelization of different serial algorithm like Jarvis March, Graham Scan and Divide and Conquer approaches.

In this research project, we present a parallel implementation of quickhull algorithm using CUDA to accelerate the computation of 2D convex hull. This project also features the optimization of common sequential algorithms
such as Graham scan, Jarvis march, and Quickhull using parallel programming. Furthermore, we provide an analysis of the performance of these algorithms with their CPU counterparts
